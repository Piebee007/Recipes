                    "In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni until it is al dente.",
                    "Meanwhile, melt the butter over medium heat in a separate saucepan. Add the flour and mix until well combined. Cook the roux for 2 minutes.",
                    "Gradually add the milk to the saucepan, stirring continuously to prevent lumps and to ensure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.",
                    "Cook the sauce for 10-15 minutes, adding more milk if it becomes too thick. Once cooked, turn off the heat and stir in the paprika, black pepper, and cumin.",
                    "Add the grated cheese and the cooked bacon/chorizo mixture to the sauce. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings as needed, considering that additional salt may not be necessary due to the presence of cheese and chorizo.",
                    "Combine the macaroni with the cheese sauce and pour the mixture into a large oven-proof dish. Top it with additional cheese and bake at 200Â°C for 25-30 minutes, or until the top becomes crispy."
