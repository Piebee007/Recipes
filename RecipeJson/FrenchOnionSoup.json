                    "Ad the Worcestershire sauce and thyme and mix well. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.",
                    "Pour in the stock, put the lid on the pan and allow the soup to simmer and bubble away on a low heat for 10 mintues.",
                    "Divide the soup equally into 4 ovenproof dishes on a baking tray.",
                    "Cut the crusty roll into 2cm chunks and place them on top of the soup. Break the ball of mozzarella into chunks and place them on top of the bread.",
                    "Put the baking tray in the oven for 10 minutes or until the cheese has melted and turned golden. Scatter a few thyme leaves on top and serve."
