                    "Put a frying pan on medium heat, add oil and then a quater of the beaten egg mixture. Gently move the eggs around the pan, ensuring that they coat the entire surface of the pan.",
                    "After 20-30 seconds the eggs will begin to set then add the wrap to the pan. Cook for 30 seconds then flip the wrap and eggs over. The egg should stick to the wrap.",
                    "Put 50g of cheese on the right hand side of the wrap, along with a thrd of the chopped bacon (along with any optional sauce).",
                    "Carefully fold over the wrap so that the cheese and bacon are sandwiched in the middle.",
                    "Leave the quesadilla in the pan for a further 30-45 seconds to allow the cheese to melt and the wrap to crisp on the outside.",
                    "Take the wrap out of the pan, cut into three triangles and it is ready to serve. Repeat the process."
