2 Red Chillies, chopped
1 tin of coconut milk
2tsp Tumeric
2tsp Cumin
2tbsp Honey 
2tbsp Fish sauce
Simmer the curry for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together.
While the curry is simmering, cook the noodles according to the package instructions.
Check the curry tastes correctly as the fish sauce can be very salty. If this is the case, add more honey and mix well.
Once the noodles are cooked, drain them and add them to the curry, mixing gently to coat them in the sauce.
Serve with some chopped fresh chillies for garnish.
