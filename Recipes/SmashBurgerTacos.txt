Cooking the patty:
Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Place one beef ball in the pan.
Lay a wrap on top of the ball and press down with a pan to smash the patty.
Cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottom is crispy, then carefully flip the patty.
Top the patty with a slice of cheese and cover the pan with a lid to melt the cheese.
Once melted, remove the patty from the pan.

Drizzle with ketchup if desired.
Fold the sides of the wrap over the patty to form a taco shape.
