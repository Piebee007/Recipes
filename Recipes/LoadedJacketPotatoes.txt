Loaded Cheesy Jacket Potatoes
Category: Potato
Prep Time: 0:20
Cook Time: 1:40
Serves: 3
Ingredients:
8 Bacon Rashers
2 Mozzarella Balls
200g Cream Cheese
8 Baking Potatoes
2 tbsp Chives
Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
Take each baking potato and use a fork to stab several holes into them. Wrap each potato individually in tin foil, sprinkling a little salt on each one.
Place the foil-wrapped potatoes on a baking tray and transfer them to the preheated oven. Bake for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes or until the potatoes are soft and cooked through.
While the potatoes are baking, place the bacon rashers on a separate baking tray and put them in the oven for the final 20 minutes of cooking time.
Once the potatoes are cooked, carefully remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes until they are easy to handle.
Unwrap the foil from each potato and slice them in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop out the insides into a mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the potato skins. Set the hollowed-out potato skins aside.
Season the potato insides with salt and pepper, then add the chopped crispy bacon, chives, cream cheese, and one mozzarella ball to the bowl. Mash everything together until well combined.
Spoon the mashed potato mixture back into the hollowed-out potato skins. Break the remaining mozzarella ball into small pieces and sprinkle them over the top of each potato.
Place the filled potatoes back on the baking tray and return them to the oven. Bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and golden.
Once the loaded cheesy jacket potatoes are cooked, remove them from the oven. Allow them to cool for a few minutes, then serve and enjoy!
