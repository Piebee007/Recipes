Ingredients:
4 Chicken Breasts, cubed
1 Jar of Blue Dragon Thair Red Curry Paste
1 chicken stock pot
4 nests of thin noodles
2 Red Chillies, chopped
1 tin of coconut milk
2tsp Tumeric
2tsp Cumin
2tbsp Honey 
2tbsp Fish sauce
Instructions:
Heat up a frying pan over medium heat.
Add the curry paste to the pan along with the cumin, turmeric, and a drizzle of oil. Stir and cook for a few minutes to release the flavors.
Add the chicken breasts to the pan and cook until they are cooked through.
Pour in the coconut milk and add the chicken stock pot, chillies, fish sauce and honey. Stir well to combine all the Ingredients.
Simmer the curry for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together.
While the curry is simmering, cook the noodles according to the package instructions.
Check the curry tastes correctly as the fish sauce can be very salty. If this is the case, add more honey and mix well.
Once the noodles are cooked, drain them and add them to the curry, mixing gently to coat them in the sauce.
Serve with some chopped fresh chillies for garnish.
